# Simple Version Control System (SVCS)

SVCS is a simple command-line version control system implemented in Kotlin. It allows users to track changes in their project files, commit those changes, and view commit logs.

# Features
Basic Version Control: SVCS provides basic version control functionalities such as file tracking, committing changes, and viewing commit logs.
User-Friendly Commands: SVCS offers simple and intuitive commands for users to interact with the version control system.
Efficient File Tracking: SVCS efficiently tracks changes in project files using cryptographic hashing algorithms.
Secure Commit Logs: Commit logs are securely stored and include information about the author and commit message.
Usage
# SVCS can be used via command-line interface (CLI) with the following commands:

config: Get and set a username for commit authorship.

add: Add a file to the index for tracking changes.

commit: Save changes to tracked files with a commit message.

log: View commit logs.

checkout: Restore a file to its state at a specific commit.

For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the SVCS Documentation.
